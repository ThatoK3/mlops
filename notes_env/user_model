For stroke prediction, where false negatives (missing actual stroke cases) can be life-threatening, the priority should be on high recall (sensitivity) while maintaining reasonable precision to avoid too many false alarms.

Key Considerations:
Recall (Sensitivity) is Critical â€“ Missing a stroke prediction could be fatal, so we want to minimize false negatives.

Precision Matters but is Secondary â€“ Too many false positives (predicting stroke when there isnâ€™t one) can lead to unnecessary tests, but this is less critical than missing actual strokes.

ROC-AUC is Important â€“ Measures how well the model distinguishes between stroke and non-stroke cases.

Performance Comparison (Ranked by Recall)
Model	Recall	Precision	F1 Score	ROC-AUC	Accuracy
LogisticRegression_v1	93.5%	11.6%	20.7%	84.7%	56.5%
XGBoost_v1	78.0%	10.5%	18.4%	78.3%	66.2%
SVM_v1	60.0%	11.5%	19.3%	76.6%	75.4%
RandomForest_v1	35.5%	16.2%	22.2%	80.7%	84.9%
LightGBM_v1	52.0%	10.1%	16.9%	76.6%	75.0%
Best Choice for Stroke Prediction:
âœ… LogisticRegression_v1

Highest Recall (93.5%) â€“ Captures almost all true stroke cases.

Best ROC-AUC (84.7%) â€“ Strong overall discrimination ability.

Low Precision (11.6%) is acceptable in medical screening (better to err on caution).

Alternative if Precision Needs Improvement:
ðŸ”¹ XGBoost_v1

Still high recall (78%) but better precision than LogisticRegression.

Better balanced than SVM/RandomForest.

Why Not RandomForest?
Recall is too low (35.5%) â€“ Missing ~65% of stroke cases is unacceptable for medical use.

High accuracy is misleading due to class imbalance (most people donâ€™t have strokes).

Final Recommendation:
Use LogisticRegression_v1 if the priority is maximizing detection of strokes (even with more false alarms).

Use XGBoost_v1 if you need a better precision/recall tradeoff while still catching most strokes.

Avoid RandomForest despite its high accuracyâ€”it misses too many critical cases.
